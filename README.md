<!-- [![Simple Memory Game](https://github.com/najimRizky/memory-game/blob/master/imageReadme/memory-game.png)](https://memory-game-lemon-mu.vercel.app/) -->

The main background of making this mini project is to fill my spare time. Besides that, I've never implemented any tech stack. That's why I created a mini project called "simple memory game". As the name implies, this is a game that can cultivate your memory skills. Although I actually also don't know if it works or not. There are several levels, modes, and types in this game. You can choose it according to your preference.

If you have any suggestions or criticisms, don't hesitate to let me know.
